The accompanying dataset and script will help you have a look at the last year's worth of atmospheric pressure data from the UW Atmospheric Sciences building.

I Before you begin (think on these for a half-hour or so before you dig in):

1. What do you think the dataset will look like?

	It should have a sine wave with a frequency of about a day dominating, then small fluctuations 
	from that corresponding to other changes in frequency.

2. What features do you expect to see?

	A sine wave that changes position and amplitude with frequency of ~10^-5

3. What features do you expect to see in the power spectrum?

	A peak at 10^-5, and peaks at the harmonics of this frequency.


II Time Domain

1. Plot it.

2. Nicely label the axes.

3. Does the dataset make sense? Does it align with your experience?

4. Does the sensor look like it was working correctly?

	The data is a lot lower resolution than the torsion pendulum, but there are no abrubt stops or 
	flat parts of the data so I think it is working correctly.
	I think the measurements are taken on the order of magnitude of 10^3 seconds.

5. What is the dominant timescale of fluctuations?
	
	Fluctuations around twice a day, as well as once per day. This corresponds with daily changes
	and pressure changes from the tides.


III Frequency Domain


Subtract the mean pressure (to remove the DC power) and have a look at the power spectrum.

1. Nicely label the axes of the plot

2. Does the plot make any physical sense? Is the noise level reasonable?

	The low frequency noise looks to be very high power and obstructive, it is not flat from the main peaks
	which I thought would be at 10^-5 Hz (daily oscillations) and 8.27x10^-7 Hz (bi-weekly oscillations 
	observed in the time domain).

3. What are the notable features of the power spectrum?

	There is a small peak at 1.1522x10^-5 Hz, which I assume corresponds to daily fluctuations in temperature;
	There is a large peak at 2.3026x10^-5 Hz, which is close to the second harmonic of the first osciallation,
	this corresponds to a twice daily fluctuation, and has about the same peak height as the first;
	The second and third harmonics look like they appear with peaks at 3.4552x10^-5 and 4.6015x10^-5 respectively,
	but the numbers are slightly off of the harmonics.

4. If there are lines, at which frequency do they appear?

	1/86400 (daily), 2/86400 (twice daily), and harmonics of these frequencies, as well as a peak at 8.27x10^-7 
	for every two weeks

5. If there are harmonics of a fundamental, are any of them abnormally large?

	The second harmonic is just as large as the first

6. Why? What might that mean?

	The second harmonic is also being driven, not only the first

7. Are any of the peaks split? By how much? Why?

	The peaks do not look to be split.

8. Are there any lines you'd expect to see but don't?

	The peak at 8.27x10^-7 (for two weeks) is present (on the graph it is ~8.2373x10^-7 Hz),
	but it is barely visible and not as distinct power as I would expect from the time domain graph.


IV Digging deeper

1. What time of day (referenced to 0-seconds) generally has a higher pressure than the rest of the day?

	Fitting a sine wave to the daily frequency, the first peak is offset from zero by ~65929 seconds,
	so the time of day that has the highest pressure is the first data point+65929 seconds

2. Are there any other times of day that generally have higher pressure than other times?

	Summing the daily and twice daily fits, there is a second peak at ~76106 seconds from zero that appears
	daily, so the pressure peaks every day at 65929+86400n seconds and 76106+86400n seconds 
	from the zero point.
